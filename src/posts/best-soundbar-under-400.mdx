      The Vizio V Series V51-H6 sound 300 is the best soundbar we've ever
      tested. This versatile 5.1 setup comes with a subwoofer and two dedicated
      satellite speakers to immerse you in audio. It also gets stronger with a
      lot of pressure to use it in a large room or at a crowded party.


      Overall, it has a balanced, neutral sound profile suitable for listening to a wide variety of audio content. It comes with four EQ presets, so you have some ability to customize its sound, and it also has the feature of dialogue enhancement. You can stream podcasts or audiobooks from your phone to the bar without any hassle using the Bluetooth connection.


      Unfortunately, this soundbar does not support Dolby Atmos content, and since it does not have a full HDMI in the port, you cannot use it for 4k Passthrough.

      If you can adjust your bar's sound to your exact needs, the Samsung
      HW-R650 will be a good option for you. It has a 7 band graphic EQ, which
      gives you a lot of control over its sound.  This soundbar still has a very
      neutral sound profile, but it lacks a bit of low-bass compared to the
      Vizio soundbar.


      It can sound deafening without a lot of pressure, which is good, and it's also compatible with Bluetooth. You can even use its dialog enhancement mode or its auto-volume mode to enhance your TV viewing experience.


      The Samsung HW-R650 has a good overall soundbar. This 3.1 system setup has a good frequency response but lacks sub-bass. Conversely, due to the dedicated center channel, the frequency of voices and dialogues are accurate and clear.


      <FeaturesBox title="Main Features Of Samsung HW-R650 Soundbar" features={["Dedicated Central Channel","Delivers Clear Dialogue","Wireless Subwoofer","Smart Sound Technology","Gaming Mode","Clutter-Free Wireless Connectivity","7-Band Graphic EQ"]} />


      #### Verdict:


      The Samsung HW-R650 soundbar will perform much better with a variety of content. Its sound profile is quite neutral and accurate. However, there is a slight lack of sub-bass, prominent in movies and bass-heavy music.
    pros:
      - A decent stereo sound profile
      - Well-built design
      - Good overall performance at high volume.
      - Dialog enhancement mode
      - 7-Band Graphic EQ

      The Bose TV Speaker is the best small soundbar under 300 that we have
      tested. It is designed in a compact shape and It doesn't take up much
      space in your current setup. It comes with optical and HDMI ARC ports so
      you can connect it very easily to your TV. Overall, it has an excellent
      construction standard, and its material feels strong and durable.


      It has a neutral, balanced sound profile that is suitable for listening to many different audio contents. Although it doesn't have a low bass connection, it has a bass adjustment feature to improve its sound. You can also use the extended dialogue feature to help make the sound clearer and crisp.


      Unfortunately, this low-pitched sound struggles to get louder, and when you play it at maximum volume, it also gets a little bit of compression. It does not support Dolby Atmos content, and it lacks EQ to help customize your sound.

      If you are looking for the best soundbar under 400, I will suggest you TCL
      Alto 5+ soundbar. It comes with a dedicated subwoofer. This 2.1 setup has
      added an extra boost and punches to the bass range, making it suitable for
      the bass-heavy music genre and action-packed movies. It's well-built and
      small and compact, so it fits easily between the legs of your TV.


      It has a very bass-heavy default sound profile which can be a bit muddy. Still, these middle and double boundaries are appropriate and balanced so that the voice and dialogue can be presented correctly. If you prefer a different sound, there are some EQ presets available in this soundbar. You can also use the dialogue enhancement feature to make the sound clearer and crisp.


      It doesn't come with many inputs or connectivity options, which can be frustrating for some listeners. 


      <FeaturesBox title="Main Features Of TCL Alto 5+ Soundbar" features={["The clean and loud sound","Minimalistic design","Wireless subwoofer for extra bass","Quick and hassle-free setup","Include all cables and wall mounting bracket"]} />


      #### Verdict:


      The TCL Alto 5+ has very bass-heavy and dark sound audio reproduction. This can be a great option for bass-heavy music and action movies with lots of basses.
    pros:
      - Good build quality
      - Small and compact design
      - Fits between the legs of TV stands

      The Sonos Arc full 5.1.2 setup is a great soundbar, especially for TVs. It
      looks perfectly balanced out of the box and features many custom tools to
      make it sound the way you want. This is a premium feeling soundbar setup
      with amazing surround and good Atmos performance. However, some may be
      frustrated by the lack of Bluetooth compatibility and DTS support.


      Unfortunately, our current test method does not generate energy in the low bass coming from this setup, resulting in very low scores that do not match the average user experience.


      <FeaturesBox title="Main Features Of Sonos Arc Soundbar" features={["Brilliantly Realistic Sound","3D Sound with Dolby Atmos","Ideal Soundbar For Movies, Musics and Gaming","Wireless Subwoofer For Deep Bass","Brilliant and Room-Filling Sound","Stream Sound Directly From Your iPhone or iPad"]} />


      #### Verdict:


      The Sonos Arc 5.1.2 setup is perfect for movies. The Sonos soundbar uses up-firing speakers to simulate the height with Atmos content. This is one of the best soundbars I reviewed so far.
    pros:
      - Wide Soundstage
      - A very well-balanced sound profile
      - Excellent surround performance
      - Decent Atmos performance
      - Sleek and very well-built design
