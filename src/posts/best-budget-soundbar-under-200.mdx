      If you search for the best budget soundbar under 200, Sony S200F will be
      the best pick for you. The sony S200F soundbar comes with many advanced
      features. If you want to connect your soundbar to your TV using an HDMI
      cable, then it will be a premium pick for you. It has an HDMI ARC port to
      support Dolby Digital content, which is found on many Blu-ray discs and
      streaming platforms.


      It can be slightly higher with a low compression pattern and has a dialogue enhancement feature that can improve vocal quality. However, while it has an integrated subwoofer, it strives to deliver a deeper bass response. It also lacks an AUX jack to connect to older media players such as the Turntable.

If you are looking for a soundbar with a well-balanced sound profile and love to watch movies and need an HDMI ARC port for connectivity, you need to pick the Sony S200F soundbar. It will be an ideal pick for you.

      The best budget soundbar under $200 that we have tested is the Bose Solo 5
      soundbar. It's relatively compact and has a small footprint we've seen,
      making it great for small TVs or under computer monitors. The soundbar
      itself feels very well built and comes with most cables that you will need
      in fixing and run it.

      It sounds amazingly decent, especially considering that it doesn't have a subwoofer. While it may not produce the low-end thump and rumble, you'll find it in your favorite hip-hop album or action movie. It presents all the vocals and instruments accurately and works well for handling dialogue.

      It is an ideal soundbar for TV shows, listen to podcasts or audiobooks and all kinds of movies.
