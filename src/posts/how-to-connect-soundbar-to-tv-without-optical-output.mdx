  Connecting your soundbar to your TV is an easy process. However, before you can connect your soundbar, your TV set will need to support HDMI-ARC, allowing audio to travel in both directions with the cable. The ARC stands for ‘Audio Return Channel,’ and it was introduced in 2009 and let you use the HDMI as both an audio input and output.


  Most of the HDMI ports that come on the TV are just input. It means that the port will not send anything from the TV, but they only receive data. If your TV supports ARC, you will be able to connect all of your kits to your soundbar and then use an HDMI cable to connect your soundbar to your TV.


  ## How To Connect Soundbar To TV With HDMI - Three Steps


  * First of all, make sure that both your TV and soundbar are turned on.

  * Locate the HDMI output on your soundbar and plug-in its one end of the HDMI cable.

  * Find the HDMI IN (ARC) port and plug in the other end of the HDMI cable on your TV set.


  With the new soundbar, you must select the HDMI option to play the sound. Does connecting the soundbar with HDMI come with its advantages? The simple answer is yes. HDMI cable makes it possible to transmit large amounts of compressed audio data.

  The HDMI connection will also implement new sound formats such as Dolby Atmos and DTS: X and compete with sound systems from 5.1, 7.1 to surround sound and even more.


  ## Connecting Soundbar To TV via Bluetooth

  First, you need to make sure that both your TV and soundbar support Bluetooth technology. If Yes, then you can go for the further steps.


  If your TV or soundbar lacks Bluetooth, you can use a Totronics BA10 Bluetooth transmitter to convert it into a Bluetooth capable device. Add a transmitter to your soundbar, and you'll hear TV audio from your soundbar.


  Different TV sets have different ways to access the Bluetooth option. Go to the Bluetooth menu of your TV and click on Pair device. You will get your soundbar name, connect it and enjoy your TV music on the soundbar.

  * Check the audio-in port on your soundbar and plug the black end RCA cable in.

  * Connect the white and red RCA ends to their corresponding audio-out ports on your TV.
